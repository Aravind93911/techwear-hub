# 🧠 TechWear Hub

**TechWear Hub** is a beginner-friendly, front-end e-commerce website for wearable tech products — built with **HTML**, **CSS (PicoCSS)**, and **JavaScript**.  
It demonstrates how to create a **multi-page, connected shopping site** using only static front-end files (perfect for GitHub Pages hosting).

## 💡 How It Works

### 🛒 Cart System
- Items are saved to `localStorage` under the key `cartItems`
- They persist between page loads and appear on the cart page

### 🔐 Login System
- Username is stored in `localStorage` (`loggedUser`)
- Navbar updates to display “Welcome, username”

### ⚙️ Admin Simulation
- Admin login credentials:


Username: admin
Password: admin123

- Shows dynamically generated attack logs using JavaScript (simulating a trained ML detector)

## 🧠 Example Simulation Output (Admin)

| Time | IP Address | Request | Prediction |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 10:45:23 | 192.168.0.22 | `' OR 1=1 --` | SQLi detected |
| 10:46:05 | 192.168.0.88 | `SELECT * FROM users` | Normal request |
